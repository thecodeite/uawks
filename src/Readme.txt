-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Unofficial Apple Wireless Keyboard Support (UAWKS) is a small package that
  allows Windows users to make full use of Apple's uber-sexy bluetooth keyboard.
  Most importantly, it provides support for essential keys that don't work out
  of the box:

          | Function                    | Key Combination            |
          |----------------------------------------------------------|
          | Forward Delete              | Fn + Delete                |
          | Home, End, Page Up and Down | Fn + Arrow Keys            |
          | Media and volume control    | Fn + F7-F12                |
          | Print Screen                | Fn + F3                    |
          | CTRL-ALT-DEL                | Control + Alt + Delete     |
          | Eject                       | Eject                      |

  Other features (enable expert mode, then right-click the notification icon to
  toggle optional ones):

  - Translucent volume overlay.
